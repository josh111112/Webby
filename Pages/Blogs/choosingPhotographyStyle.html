                        <p class="blog-intro">
                            When planning your wedding, one of the most personal—and lasting—decisions you'll make is choosing your photography style.
                             Long after the cake is eaten and the dress is packed away, your wedding photos are what remain. 
                             They tell the story of your day, capture your people, and reflect the energy and emotion you felt.
                              So how do you choose a photography style that feels right for you?
                              If you're searching for a wedding photographer in Grand Rapids or anywhere across West Michigan, 
                              understanding the different photography styles is a great first step toward finding a photographer
                               who speaks your visual language.

                    <div class="blog-section">
                        <h2>What are the most common photography styles?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Before diving in, it's worth noting: style isn't just about how the photos look—it's also about how they feel.
                             That feeling should align with who you are as a couple. Here are the most popular photography styles:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Light & Airy</li>
                                <p>This style is soft, pastel-toned, and dreamy. Think glowing sunlight, bright whites, and a romantic, almost whimsical vibe. 
                                    Often favored for outdoor weddings or springtime ceremonies.</p>

                                <li>Dark & Moody</li>
                                <p>With rich shadows, deep tones, and dramatic contrast, the dark & moody style evokes emotion and atmosphere. 
                                    It's perfect for couples who love a more artistic, cinematic look. This is one of the styles I specialize in—it's timeless, yet bold.</p>

                                <li>True-to-Color</li>
                                <p>As the name suggests, this approach keeps colors as close to real life as possible. 
                                    Greens look green, skin tones stay natural, and your photos reflect your wedding exactly as you experienced it. 
                                    It's a versatile choice that works well in any season or venue. I also shoot in this style because it balances authenticity with elegance.</p>

                                <li>Documentary or Photojournalistic</li>
                                <p>This focuses on candid moments, storytelling, and natural emotion over posed portraits. 
                                    Great for couples who want their day captured as it genuinely unfolded.</p>

                                <li>Editorial or Fine Art</li>
                                <p>Styled, curated, and magazine-worthy. Editorial-style photography often includes posed shots with an artistic flair. 
                                    Think fashion-forward, often with dramatic lighting or composition.</p>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rather than choosing a style just because it's trending on Instagram, think about your personality as a couple. 
                            Are you playful or poetic? Bold or minimal? Do you lean toward warm autumn tones or breezy spring pastels?
                            Your photography should reflect not just what your wedding looks like—but what it feels like to be you two together.
                            If you're unsure, start by creating a mood board. Save photos you love—even if you can't explain why.
                            A pattern will often emerge that reveals the style that resonates with you most.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Getting married in downtown Grand Rapids? A true-to-color or editorial style might highlight the modern, urban feel.
                             Tying the knot near Lake Michigan or in the forests of West Michigan? 
                             A darker, moodier palette may beautifully emphasize the natural surroundings.
                            That said, your style should always center on you, not just your venue.
                             I've shot true-to-color weddings in candlelit barns and dark & moody weddings on sunny beaches. 
                             Style is flexible when approached intentionally.

                        <p>
                            I specialize in dark & moody and true-to-color photography. 
                            I'm drawn to raw emotion, natural light, and storytelling that feels rich and real. 
                            Whether you're getting married in Grand Rapids, Saugatuck, Holland, or anywhere in West Michigan, my goal is to capture the vibe of your day in a way that's artistic yet authentic.
                            I also work with couples to understand what matters most to them—whether that's moody portraits in the woods or vibrant candids on a bustling dance floor.
